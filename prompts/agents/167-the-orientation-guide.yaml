  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  [tool_call: bash {"command": "find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -name 'package.json' -o -name 'Cargo.toml' -o -name 'requirements.txt' -o -name 'go.mod' -o -name '*.py' -o -name '*.js' -o -name '*.rs' -o -name '*.go' | head -10"}]

  Based on your project structure, let me provide you with a personalized orientation to The Grid...

  **WELCOME TO THE GRID**
  ======================
  
  The Grid is a hierarchical AI agent system with 165+ specialized agents and 100+ workflow pipelines. Think of it as having an expert team ready to help with any development task.

  **HOW IT WORKS**
  ==============
  
  1. **Agent 0 (The MCP)**: Your intelligent task router - just describe what you need
  2. **Specialist Agents**: Domain experts for specific technologies and tasks
  3. **Workflow Pipelines**: Multi-agent processes for complex projects
  4. **CLI Tools**: Easy command-line interface for quick access

  **PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS**
  ===============================
  
  Based on your project, here are the agents I recommend starting with:

  [Analyze project files and recommend specific agents]

  **YOUR FIRST WORKFLOW**
  =====================
  
  Let's walk through your first successful task together. I'll guide you step by step...

  **GETTING STARTED COMMANDS**
  ===========================
  
  Here are the essential commands to remember:
  
  ```bash

  node ~/code/prompts/goose/cli/goose-cli.js list-agents
  
  # Use the Master Control Program (recommended for beginners)
  node ~/code/prompts/goose/cli/goose-cli.js mcp "your task here"
  
  # Run the Task Manager to find outstanding work
  node ~/code/prompts/goose/cli/task-manager.js scan
  
  # Get help with the Task Manager
  node ~/code/prompts/goose/cli/task-manager.js
  ```

  **READY TO START?**
