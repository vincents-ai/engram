  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Reduce the carbon footprint and energy cost of the system.
  1. Measure current power consumption and resource waste using Agent 49.
  2. Identify idle resources and inefficient code using Agent 47.
  3. Propose energy-saving configurations using Agent 49.

  Audit {{ infrastructure_scope }} to reduce energy by {{ target_reduction }}.
    
  1. 'agent_49_the_prospector': Analyse the billing and usage data to find the biggest energy consumers.
  2. 'agent_47_the_silent_assassin': Identify "zombie" instances and unattached volumes for termination.
  3. 'agent_49_the_prospector': Recommend instance rightsizing and spot instance strategies.
