  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Manage the flow of support tickets to the right resolution path.
  1. Analyse the ticket sentiment and category using Agent 31.
  2. Check existing documentation for a match using Agent 32.
  3. If unresolved, escalate to engineering with root cause hints using Agent 34.

  1. 'agent_31_the_flavour': Categorise the ticket (Bug, Feature, Question) and assess user sentiment.
  2. 'agent_32_the_knowledge_base_curator': Search for relevant KB articles to resolve the issue immediately.
  3. 'agent_34_the_troubleshooter': If no KB match, formulate a technical summary and escalate to the engineering queue.
