  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  End-to-end FPGA development workflow.
  1. Synthesise the HDL design to a netlist using Agent 58.
  2. Perform place-and-route to generate the bitstream using Agent 58.
  3. Upload the bitstream to the device via JTAG using Agent 58.

prompt: |
  Build and flash the FPGA project at {{ project_path }} for {{ device_id }}.
    
  1. 'agent_58_the_silicon': Run synthesis and implementation tools (e.g., Vivado/Quartus/Yosys).
  2. 'agent_58_the_silicon': Generate the final .bit or .bin file.
  3. 'agent_58_the_silicon': Execute the openocd or vendor command to program the device.
