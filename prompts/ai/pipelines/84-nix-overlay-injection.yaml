  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Customise software versions in the Nix store.
  1. Write the overlay function using Agent 54.
  2. Apply it to the package configuration using Agent 54.
  3. Verify the new package version using Agent 15.

  Overlay {{ package_name }} with version {{ custom_version }}.
    
  1. 'agent_54_the_snowflake': Define a Nix overlay function that uses `overrideAttrs` or `override`.
  2. 'agent_54_the_snowflake': Update `flake.nix` to include this overlay in `pkgs` instantiation.
  3. 'agent_15_the_tester': Run `nix run .#{{ package_name }} --version` to confirm the change.
