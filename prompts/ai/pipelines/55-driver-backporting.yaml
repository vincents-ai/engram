  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Make new hardware work on old systems.
  1. Analyse the API differences between kernel versions using Agent 16.
  2. Modify the driver code to use legacy APIs using Agent 59.
  3. Compile and test the backported module using Agent 59.

  Backport {{ driver_source }} to kernel {{ target_kernel }}.
    
  1. 'agent_16_the_16_bit': Identify modern kernel functions in the driver that don't exist in {{ target_kernel }}.
  2. 'agent_59_the_driver': Rewrite the function calls using the equivalent legacy APIs or shims.
  3. 'agent_59_the_driver': Attempt to build against the {{ target_kernel }} headers and fix compilation errors.
