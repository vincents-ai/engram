  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Calibrate slicer settings for a new filament.
  1. Generate calibration models (temp tower, retraction test) using Agent 151.
  2. Analyse the print results using Agent 103 (acting as slicer expert).
  3. Update the slicer profile using Agent 103.

  Tune profile for {{ material }} on {{ printer_model }}.
    
  1. 'agent_03_the_architect': Create G-code for a temperature tower ranging from 190C to 230C.
  2. 'agent_15_the_tester': Inspect the printed tower for stringing and bridging quality.
  3. 'agent_15_the_tester': Recommend the optimal temperature and retraction distance.
