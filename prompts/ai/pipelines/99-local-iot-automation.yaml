instructions: |
  Automate smart home devices locally.
  1. Subscribe to MQTT topics using Agent 148 (acting as edge compute).
  2. Process logic rules using Agent 148.
  3. Publish control commands using Agent 148.

  Implement "{{ logic_rule }}" on broker {{ broker_url }}.
    
  1. 'agent_02_the_sidekick': Listen for the trigger topic defined in the rule.
  2. 'agent_59_the_driver': Execute the logic (e.g., compare sensor values).
  3. 'agent_02_the_sidekick': Publish the payload to the target device topic.
