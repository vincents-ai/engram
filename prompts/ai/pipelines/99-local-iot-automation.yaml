  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Automate smart home devices locally.
  1. Subscribe to MQTT topics using Agent 148 (acting as edge compute).
  2. Process logic rules using Agent 148.
  3. Publish control commands using Agent 148.

  Implement "{{ logic_rule }}" on broker {{ broker_url }}.
    
  1. 'agent_02_the_sidekick': Listen for the trigger topic defined in the rule.
  2. 'agent_59_the_driver': Execute the logic (e.g., compare sensor values).
  3. 'agent_02_the_sidekick': Publish the payload to the target device topic.
