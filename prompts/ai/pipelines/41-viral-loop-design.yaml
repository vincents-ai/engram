title: "Viral Loop Design"
description: "Engineer referral mechanisms to drive growth."
instructions: |
  Design and implement features that encourage users to invite others.
  1. Analyse user incentives and psychology using Agent 30.
  2. Design the viral mechanism and sharing flow using Agent 27.
  3. Define the metrics to track the K-factor using Agent 20.

prompt: |
  Design a viral loop for {{ product_feature }} with {{ incentive_type }} rewards.
    
  1. 'agent_30_the_behaviourist': Analyse why a user would want to share this and how {{ incentive_type }} motivates them.
  2. 'agent_27_the_rock_star': Create a "noisy" and exciting sharing flow that maximises social visibility.
  3. 'agent_20_the_critical_roller': Define the tracking events needed to calculate the Viral Coefficient (K-factor).
