  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Design and implement features that encourage users to invite others.
  1. Analyse user incentives and psychology using Agent 30.
  2. Design the viral mechanism and sharing flow using Agent 27.
  3. Define the metrics to track the K-factor using Agent 20.

prompt: |
  Design a viral loop for {{ product_feature }} with {{ incentive_type }} rewards.
    
  1. 'agent_30_the_behaviourist': Analyse why a user would want to share this and how {{ incentive_type }} motivates them.
  2. 'agent_27_the_rock_star': Create a "noisy" and exciting sharing flow that maximises social visibility.
  3. 'agent_20_the_critical_roller': Define the tracking events needed to calculate the Viral Coefficient (K-factor).
