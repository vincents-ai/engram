  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Convert HDL code into a bitstream for FPGAs.
  1. Write or validate the Verilog/VHDL code using Agent 58.
  2. Synthesise the design and map to hardware using Agent 58.
  3. Verify timing constraints using Agent 60.

  Synthesise {{ top_module }} for {{ fpga_family }}.
    
  1. 'agent_58_the_silicon': Check the Verilog code for syntax errors and synthesise the netlist.
  2. 'agent_58_the_silicon': Map the design to the {{ fpga_family }} resources (LUTs, DSPs).
  3. 'agent_60_the_real_time': Check the timing reports to ensure the design meets frequency requirements.
