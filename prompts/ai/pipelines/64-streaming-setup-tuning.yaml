  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Optimise settings for live streaming.
  1. Analyse network stability and upload speed using Agent 19 (acting as network tuner).
  2. Configure encoder settings (x264/NVENC) using Agent 65.
  3. Verify stream health and dropped frames using Agent 92 (acting as bitrate monitor).

  Tune OBS for {{ content_type }} on {{ platform }}.
    
  1. 'agent_19_the_performance_tuner': Run a speed test to determine maximum stable bitrate.
  2. 'agent_65_the_transcoder': Generate the optimal OBS encoding flags for high-motion {{ content_type }}.
  3. 'agent_92_the_bitrate': Calculate the b-frame and keyframe interval settings to prevent buffering.
