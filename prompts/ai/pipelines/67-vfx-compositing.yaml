  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Combine CGI elements with live-action footage.
  1. Track camera motion and solve the scene using Agent 29 (acting as matchmover).
  2. Render the 3D elements with matching lighting using Agent 10.
  3. Composite layers and match grain using Agent 67.

  Composite {{ cgi_asset }} into {{ background_plate }}.
    
  1. 'agent_29_the_visualisation_expert': Generate a 3D camera track from {{ background_plate }}.
  2. 'agent_10_the_perfect_10': Position {{ cgi_asset }} in the scene and match the lighting direction.
  3. 'agent_67_the_colourist': Blend the layers, matching black levels and adding film grain.
