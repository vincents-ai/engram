instructions:
  
  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  
  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:

 'Conduct a controlled chaos engineering experiment to validate system resilience and recovery procedures.


  1. Design the failure scenario and blast radius using The Gremlin (acting as The Punk).

  2. Execute the failure simulation in a controlled environment using The DevOps Engineer.

  3. Monitor system response and recovery metrics using The Survivor.

  4. Conduct a post-mortem and identify improvements using The Troubleshooter.

prompt: 'Initiate a chaos engineering drill on {{ service_name }} simulating {{ failure_type }}.


  1. ''agent_13_the_gremlin'': Design the experiment. Define the hypothesis: "If {{ service_name }} experiences {{ failure_type }}, the system will..."

  2. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Execute the drill. Introduce the fault.

  3. ''agent_28_the_survivor'': Monitor the system''s vital signs. Did backups trigger? Did failover happen?

  4. ''agent_34_the_troubleshooter'': Analyse the logs and root cause. Why did it recover (or fail to)?
