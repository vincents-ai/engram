  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Extend battery runtime on Linux.
  1. Measure baseline power usage using Agent 49.
  2. Configure TLP or auto-cpufreq using Agent 49.
  3. Verify power draw reduction using Agent 49.

prompt: |
  Optimise {{ device_model }} to hit {{ target_idle_watts }}W idle.
    
  1. 'agent_49_the_prospector': Run `powertop` to identify wakeups and bad tunables.
  2. 'agent_49_the_prospector': Apply aggressive power policies (PCIe ASPM, CPU governor).
  3. 'agent_49_the_prospector': Confirm the discharge rate is below {{ target_idle_watts }}W.
