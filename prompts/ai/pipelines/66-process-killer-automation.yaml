  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Monitor and terminate unresponsive applications.
  1. Scan the process list for high CPU/Memory outliers using Agent 66.
  2. Verify if the process is unresponsive using Agent 47.
  3. Terminate the process safely using Agent 66.

  Watch {{ target_process_name }} and kill if hung for {{ timeout_sec }}s.
    
  1. 'agent_66_the_executioner': Monitor the PID of {{ target_process_name }}.
  2. 'agent_47_the_silent_assassin': Check if the process state is 'D' (Uninterruptible Sleep) or 'Z' (Zombie).
  3. 'agent_66_the_executioner': Send SIGTERM, wait {{ timeout_sec }}s, then send SIGKILL if needed.
