  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Ensure Gerber files match the design intent.
  1. Parse the Gerber files using Agent 75.
  2. Compare the layer alignment and drill hits using Agent 75.
  3. Render the board for visual inspection using Agent 56.

prompt: |
  Validate Gerbers in {{ gerber_path }} ({{ layer_count }} layers).
    
  1. 'agent_75_the_solder': Load the Gerber files and verify all {{ layer_count }} layers are present.
  2. 'agent_75_the_solder': Check for zero-width lines or missing drill apertures.
  3. 'agent_56_the_schematic': Generate a 3D preview to confirm the stackup order is correct.
