  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Diagnose and resolve concurrency issues in Go applications.
  1. Analyse the code for race conditions using Agent 71.
  2. Visualise the Goroutine interactions using Agent 29.
  3. Refactor the channel logic to ensure safety using Agent 71.

  Fix {{ issue_type }} in {{ package_path }}.
    
  1. 'agent_71_the_gopher': Run the race detector (`go test -race`) and analyse the output.
  2. 'agent_29_the_visualisation_expert': Map out the channel communication to identify blocking points.
  3. 'agent_71_the_gopher': Rewrite the select statements and wait groups to resolve the {{ issue_type }}.
