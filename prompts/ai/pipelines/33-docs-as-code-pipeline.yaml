  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Treat documentation like software with a robust CI pipeline.
  1. Write and structure the documentation using Agent 41.
  2. Optimise the content for SEO and discoverability using Agent 26.
  3. Verify strict type definitions in code examples using Agent 72.

  Process documentation at {{ doc_path }} for {{ target_audience }}.
    
  1. 'agent_41_the_technical_writer': Lint the markdown files and ensure clarity and consistency.
  2. 'agent_72_the_type_safe': Validate that all code snippets in the docs are syntactically correct and typed.
  3. 'agent_26_the_alphabet': Audit the headers and metadata for maximum search engine visibility.
