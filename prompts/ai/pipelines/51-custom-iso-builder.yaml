  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Create a custom Linux distribution image.
  1. Define the package set and configuration using Agent 54.
  2. Build the ISO image using Agent 52.
  3. Verify the image boot process using Agent 15.

  Build the {{ iso_name }} ISO with {{ desktop_environment }}.
    
  1. 'agent_54_the_snowflake': Create the flake.nix or build configuration defining the system packages.
  2. 'agent_52_the_iso': Execute the build process to generate the raw ISO file.
  3. 'agent_15_the_tester': Test the ISO in a VM to ensure it reaches the login screen.
