  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Inspect network traffic for anomalies.
  1. Capture packets using Agent 110 (acting as sniffer).
  2. Filter by protocol and visualise flows using Agent 110.
  3. Identify suspicious patterns using Agent 07.

  Capture and analyse traffic on {{ interface }} (Filter: {{ capture_filter }}).
    
  1. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Run `tcpdump` or `tshark` to capture the pcap file.
  2. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Analyse the pcap for cleartext credentials or known malware signatures.
  3. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Summarise the top talkers and connection durations.
