  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Ensure hardware design accuracy before manufacturing.
  1. Extract pin definitions from the datasheet using Agent 74.
  2. Compare against the schematic symbol using Agent 56.
  3. Flag any discrepancies using Agent 74.

prompt: |
  Verify pinout for {{ component_part_number }} (Symbol: {{ schematic_symbol_name }}).
    
  1. 'agent_74_the_pinout': Parse the pin table from the PDF datasheet of {{ component_part_number }}.
  2. 'agent_56_the_schematic': Export the netlist/pin list from the schematic symbol.
  3. 'agent_74_the_pinout': Cross-reference every pin number and name, reporting any mismatches.
