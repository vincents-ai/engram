  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Fix issues with digital signals.
  1. Capture the waveform using Agent 64 (acting as logic analyser).
  2. Analyse rise times and ringing using Agent 57.
  3. Recommend termination or layout changes using Agent 57.

  Debug signal integrity on {{ net_name }} ({{ protocol }}).
    
  1. 'agent_64_the_commodore': Analyse the captured trace for setup/hold time violations.
  2. 'agent_57_the_router': Check the impedance of the trace on the PCB layout.
  3. 'agent_57_the_router': Suggest adding series resistors or adjusting the trace length.
