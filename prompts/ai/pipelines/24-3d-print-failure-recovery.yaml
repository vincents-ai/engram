title: "3D Print Failure Recovery"
description: "Diagnose adhesion issues and print failures."
instructions: |
  Analyse and fix failed 3D prints.
  1. Inspect the failure mode and symptoms using Agent 13 (acting as failure detective).
  2. Adjust print settings and parameters using Agent 15 (acting as tester).
  3. Validate the fix with a test print logic using Agent 15.

  Diagnose the {{ failure_description }} issue with {{ material }}.
    
  1. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Analyse the symptoms of {{ failure_description }} and identify potential root causes.
  2. 'agent_15_the_tester': Suggest modified print settings to mitigate the error.
  3. 'agent_15_the_tester': Outline a test print procedure to confirm the fix.
