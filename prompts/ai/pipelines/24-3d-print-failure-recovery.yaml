  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Analyse and fix failed 3D prints.
  1. Inspect the failure mode and symptoms using Agent 13 (acting as failure detective).
  2. Adjust print settings and parameters using Agent 15 (acting as tester).
  3. Validate the fix with a test print logic using Agent 15.

prompt: |
  Diagnose the {{ failure_description }} issue with {{ material }}.
    
  1. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Analyse the symptoms of {{ failure_description }} and identify potential root causes.
  2. 'agent_15_the_tester': Suggest modified print settings to mitigate the error.
  3. 'agent_15_the_tester': Outline a test print procedure to confirm the fix.
