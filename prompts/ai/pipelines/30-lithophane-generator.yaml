  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Create lithophanes from standard images.
  1. Process the input image for contrast and inversion using Agent 10.
  2. Generate the heightmap and 3D mesh using Agent 73.
  3. Validate the STL for printing using Agent 75.

prompt: |
  Create a {{ shape }} lithophane from {{ image_path }}.
    
  1. 'agent_10_the_perfect_10': Convert the image to greyscale and optimise contrast for backlighting.
  2. 'agent_73_the_prime': Calculate the z-heights based on pixel luminosity and generate the mesh points.
  3. 'agent_75_the_solder': Export the final STL and check for non-manifold geometry.
