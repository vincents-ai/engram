  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Recover lost data from a disk image.
  1. Create a read-only image of the drive using Agent 52 (acting as disk imager).
  2. Scan the file system structures for deleted entries using Agent 109 (acting as forensic expert).
  3. Carve files based on magic headers using Agent 109.

  Recover {{ file_type }} files from {{ disk_image }}.
    
  1. 'agent_52_the_iso': Mount the image as read-only loop device.
  2. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Run `photorec` or `scalpel` on the image targeting {{ file_type }}.
  3. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Verify the integrity of recovered files by checking file headers.
