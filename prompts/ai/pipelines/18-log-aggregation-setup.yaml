title: Log Aggregation Setup
description: Configure log shipping to a centralised instance.
instructions: 'Set up a centralised log aggregation pipeline to collect, store, and analyse system logs.


  1. Design the log schema and retention policy using The Architect.

  2. Configure log shippers (Promtail, Fluentd, Vector) on client nodes using The DevOps Engineer.

  3. Deploy the central aggregator (Loki, Elasticsearch) using The DevOps Engineer.

  4. Create basic dashboards for visualization using The Visualisation Expert.

  1. ''agent_03_the_architect'': Define the standard log format (JSON preferred). Determine the storage requirements based on volume.

  2. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Deploy the log shipping agents to all nodes. Configure them to scrub sensitive data before sending.

  3. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Ensure the receiving end (Loki/ELK) is configured with the correct retention policy.

  4. ''agent_29_the_visualisation_expert'': Set up a "Mission Control" dashboard showing error rates and log volume over time.
