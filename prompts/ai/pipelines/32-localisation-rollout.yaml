  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Deploy a new language or locale across the application.
  1. Extract text strings and manage translation keys using Agent 16 (acting as legacy refactorer).
  2. Implement the new locale in the frontend using Agent 10.
  3. Verify layout integrity and text expansion using Agent 10.

prompt: |
  Roll out the {{ locale_code }} localisation for {{ component_scope }}.
    
  1. 'agent_16_the_16_bit': Identify hardcoded strings in {{ component_scope }} and move them to the translation file.
  2. 'agent_10_the_perfect_10': Apply the new locale strings to the UI components.
  3. 'agent_10_the_perfect_10': Check for UI breakage caused by longer text strings in {{ locale_code }}.
