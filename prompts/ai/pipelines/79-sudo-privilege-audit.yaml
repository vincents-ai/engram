  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Review and restrict root privileges.
  1. Scan the sudoers file for dangerous configurations using Agent 79 (acting as root admin).
  2. Identify users with excessive permissions using Agent 07.
  3. Generate a hardened configuration using Agent 79.

  Audit {{ sudoers_path }} with {{ policy_strictness }} strictness.
    
  1. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Check for `NOPASSWD` entries and wildcard commands.
  2. 'agent_47_the_silent_assassin': Remove users who haven't logged in recently from the sudo group.
  3. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Write a new configuration that explicitly lists allowed commands for each group.
