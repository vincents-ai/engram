description: "Simulate attacks to test defences."
instructions: |
  Conduct a simulated cyberattack on the infrastructure.
  1. Plan the attack vectors and scope using Agent 44.
  2. Execute the penetration tests using Agent 13 (acting as adversary).
  3. Analyse the defensive response and gaps using Agent 07.

prompt: |
  Conduct a Red Team exercise on {{ target_system }} using {{ attack_type }}.
    
  1. 'agent_44_the_critic': devise a strategy to exploit weaknesses in {{ target_system }} via {{ attack_type }}.
  2. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Execute the simulated attack, logging all successful breaches.
  3. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Review the system logs to see if the attack was detected and blocked.
