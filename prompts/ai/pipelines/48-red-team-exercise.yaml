  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Conduct a simulated cyberattack on the infrastructure.
  1. Plan the attack vectors and scope using Agent 44.
  2. Execute the penetration tests using Agent 13 (acting as adversary).
  3. Analyse the defensive response and gaps using Agent 07.

prompt: |
  Conduct a Red Team exercise on {{ target_system }} using {{ attack_type }}.
    
  1. 'agent_44_the_critic': devise a strategy to exploit weaknesses in {{ target_system }} via {{ attack_type }}.
  2. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Execute the simulated attack, logging all successful breaches.
  3. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Review the system logs to see if the attack was detected and blocked.
