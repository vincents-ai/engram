  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Fix vulnerabilities in legacy kernels.
  1. Fetch the upstream patch for the CVE using Agent 13 (acting as vulnerability researcher).
  2. Attempt to apply the patch to the source tree using Agent 59.
  3. Resolve conflicts and rebuild using Agent 59.

prompt: |
  Backport {{ cve_id }} to kernel {{ kernel_version }}.
    
  1. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Download the fix for {{ cve_id }} from the mainline kernel git.
  2. 'agent_59_the_driver': Run `patch -p1` and identify any rejected hunks.
  3. 'agent_59_the_driver': Manually resolve the conflicts by understanding the code drift.
