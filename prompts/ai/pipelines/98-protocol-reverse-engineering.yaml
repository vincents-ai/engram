instructions: |
  Understand how a proprietary device communicates.
  1. Capture the binary stream using Agent 110.
  2. Identify patterns and fields using Agent 98 (acting as reverse engineer).
  3. Write a parser/dissector using Agent 98.

  Reverse engineer protocol in {{ pcap_file }}.
    
  1. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Hex-dump the payloads and look for repeating headers or checksums.
  2. 'agent_16_the_16_bit': Map the byte offsets to potential data types (uint8, float32).
  3. 'agent_16_the_16_bit': Generate a Wireshark dissector script (Lua) to parse the stream.
