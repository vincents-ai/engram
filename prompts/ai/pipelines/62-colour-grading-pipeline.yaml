  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Create a consistent look across video clips.
  1. Balance exposure and white balance using Agent 67.
  2. Apply Look Up Tables (LUTs) and creative grading using Agent 67.
  3. Verify colour consistency across the timeline using Agent 10.

  Grade the project {{ project_file }} with a {{ target_look }} style.
    
  1. 'agent_67_the_colourist': Analyse the scopes (waveform/vectorscope) to neutralise the footage.
  2. 'agent_67_the_colourist': Apply the primary grade and the {{ target_look }} LUT.
  3. 'agent_10_the_perfect_10': Scan the timeline to ensure skin tones are natural and shots match.
