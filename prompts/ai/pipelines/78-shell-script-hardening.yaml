  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Make shell scripts robust and secure.
  1. Lint the code for common errors using Agent 78 (acting as shell expert).
  2. Refactor to use strict modes (`set -euo pipefail`) using Agent 16.
  3. Verify POSIX compliance using Agent 78.

  Harden {{ script_path }} for {{ shell_type }}.
    
  1. 'agent_47_the_silent_assassin': Run `shellcheck` (simulated) to find unsafe quoting and logic errors.
  2. 'agent_16_the_16_bit': Rewrite the script header to include `set -euo pipefail`.
  3. 'agent_16_the_16_bit': Replace deprecated backticks with `$()` and ensure variables are quoted.
