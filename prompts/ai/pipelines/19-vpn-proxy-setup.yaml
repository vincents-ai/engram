  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

 'Establish secure remote access or traffic routing using VPNs or Reverse Proxies.


  1. Design the network topology and access controls using The Architect (acting as The Proxy).

  2. Generate WireGuard keys or SSL certificates using The Double-O.

  3. Configure the interface (WireGuard) or server block (Nginx) using The DevOps Engineer.

  4. Verify connectivity and leakage using The Tester (acting as The Sniffer).

  1. ''agent_03_the_architect'': Define the allowed IPs and routing table.

  2. ''agent_07_the_double_o'': If WireGuard: Generate private/public key pairs. If Nginx: Generate Let''s Encrypt certs.

  3. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Apply the configuration to the server. Ensure the firewall allows the specific UDP/TCP ports.

  4. ''agent_15_the_tester'': Test the connection from an external network. Verify that traffic is correctly encrypted and routed.
