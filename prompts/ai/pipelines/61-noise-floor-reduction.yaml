  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Remove unwanted background noise from audio recordings.
  1. Analyse the noise profile from a silent section using Agent 61.
  2. Apply spectral subtraction to the entire track using Agent 90 (acting as spectral analyst).
  3. Verify that the voice signal remains preserved using Agent 62.

  Reduce noise in {{ audio_file }} with threshold {{ noise_threshold }}dB.
    
  1. 'agent_90_the_spectrum': Capture the noise footprint from the first 5 seconds of silence.
  2. 'agent_61_the_dsp': Subtract this footprint from the main signal to clean the audio.
  3. 'agent_62_the_gain_stager': A/B test the result to ensure no "underwater" artifacts were introduced.
