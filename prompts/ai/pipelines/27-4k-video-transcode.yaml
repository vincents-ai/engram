  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Convert raw video footage into streaming-ready formats.
  1. Analyse the source file and select codecs using Agent 65.
  2. Perform the transcoding process using Agent 65.
  3. Verify the output quality using Agent 10 (acting as visual inspector).

  Transcode {{ input_file }} to 4K HEVC at {{ target_bitrate }}.
    
  1. 'agent_65_the_transcoder': Generate the FFmpeg command string for the target spec.
  2. 'agent_65_the_transcoder': Execute the encoding process (simulated).
  3. 'agent_10_the_perfect_10': Verify that the output maintains visual fidelity and colour accuracy.
