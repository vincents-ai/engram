  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Squeeze impressive graphics into tiny binaries.
  1. Write the core visual effect code using Agent 73 (acting as algo expert).
  2. Optimise the assembly/shader code for size using Agent 63 (acting as demo coder).
  3. Pack the executable using Agent 55 (acting as compression expert).

prompt: |
  Create a {{ effect_type }} demo under {{ size_limit_bytes }} bytes.
    
  1. 'agent_73_the_prime': Implement the {{ effect_type }} algorithm mathematically.
  2. 'agent_63_the_synthesiser': Convert the logic to compact shader code or assembly.
  3. 'agent_55_the_speedster': Strip headers and compress the binary to fit the limit.
