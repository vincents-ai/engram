title: "Churn Prediction Model"
description: "Train ML model to identify at-risk users."
instructions: |
  Predict which users are likely to leave the platform.
  1. Prepare the historical user data for training using Agent 23.
  2. Train the prediction model using Agent 29 (acting as data scientist).
  3. Analyse the behavioural triggers for churn using Agent 30.

prompt: |
  Build a churn model using {{ dataset_path }} ({{ lookback_period }} days).
    
  1. 'agent_23_the_enigma': Clean and normalise the data, handling missing values.
  2. 'agent_30_the_behaviourist': Identify key behavioural features (e.g., "days since last login", "ticket volume") to feed the model.
  3. 'agent_29_the_visualisation_expert': Visualise the correlation between these features and user churn.
