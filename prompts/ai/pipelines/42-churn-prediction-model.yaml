  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Predict which users are likely to leave the platform.
  1. Prepare the historical user data for training using Agent 23.
  2. Train the prediction model using Agent 29 (acting as data scientist).
  3. Analyse the behavioural triggers for churn using Agent 30.

prompt: |
  Build a churn model using {{ dataset_path }} ({{ lookback_period }} days).
    
  1. 'agent_23_the_enigma': Clean and normalise the data, handling missing values.
  2. 'agent_30_the_behaviourist': Identify key behavioural features (e.g., "days since last login", "ticket volume") to feed the model.
  3. 'agent_29_the_visualisation_expert': Visualise the correlation between these features and user churn.
