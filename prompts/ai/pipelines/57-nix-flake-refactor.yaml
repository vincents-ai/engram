  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Clean up and modularise Nix configuration.
  1. Analyse the current flake structure for duplication using Agent 54.
  2. Extract reusable components into separate files using Agent 54.
  3. Verify that the output derivation remains identical using Agent 53.

  Refactor {{ flake_path }} into {{ output_structure }}.
    
  1. 'agent_54_the_snowflake': Identify repeated patterns and inline modules in the flake.
  2. 'agent_54_the_snowflake': Move these blocks into dedicated files in {{ output_structure }} and import them.
  3. 'agent_53_the_hermit': Run `nix build` before and after to ensure the hash is unchanged.
