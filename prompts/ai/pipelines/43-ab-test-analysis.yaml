  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Statistically evaluate the results of an A/B test.
  1. Calculate the statistical significance of the results using Agent 20.
  2. Visualise the performance difference using Agent 29.
  3. Make a rollout decision based on the data using Agent 08.

prompt: |
  Analyse experiment {{ experiment_id }} for {{ metric }}.
    
  1. 'agent_20_the_critical_roller': Calculate the p-value and confidence interval for the {{ metric }} delta.
  2. 'agent_29_the_visualisation_expert': Generate a chart showing the performance of Control vs. Variant.
  3. 'agent_08_the_magic_8_ball': Output the final decision: "Rollout Variant", "Keep Control", or "More Data Needed".
