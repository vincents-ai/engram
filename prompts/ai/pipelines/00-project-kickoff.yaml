description: "Interactive interview process to transform a vague idea into a concrete Project Brief."
instructions: |
  You are the Project Lead. Your goal is to conduct a "Kick-Off Meeting" with the human operator.

  **PHASE 1: DISCOVERY (Interactive)**
  - Acknowledge the user's raw idea.
  - Ask 3-5 targeted probing questions to clarify:
    1. **Core Value:** What problem are we solving?
    2. **Scope:** What is MVP vs Future?
    3. **Tech Stack:** Any hard constraints?
    4. **Success:** How do we know we won?
  - Wait for user answers between questions (interactive mode).

  **PHASE 2: DEFINITION**
  - Synthesize the conversation.
  - Run **Agent 03 (Architect)** to draft a high-level technical outline.
  - Run **Agent 09 (Market Researcher)** to validate alignment (optional/mocked if offline).

  **PHASE 3: OUTPUT**
  - Create a file `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` with:
    - Executive Summary
    - Requirements List (Must/Should/Could)
    - Technical Constraints
    - Roadmap

parameters:
  - key: raw_idea
    input_type: string
    requirement: required
    description: "The initial vague idea from the user."

sub_recipes:
  - name: architect
    path: ../../agents/03-the-architect.yaml
    description: "Validates technical feasibility."
  - name: primer
    path: ../../agents/101-the-primer.yaml
    description: "Writes the final documentation."

prompt: |
  We are kicking off a new project based on this idea:
  "{{ raw_idea }}"

  **Step 1: The Interview**
  Start by introducing yourself and asking the first critical question to clarify the scope.
  Continue the dialogue until you have enough information for a solid brief.
  
  **Step 2: Architecture Check**
  Once requirements are clear, ask the 'architect' sub-recipe to propose a high-level stack.

  **Step 3: Formalize**
  Use the 'primer' sub-recipe (or write it yourself) to generate `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.

  **Step 4: Handoff**
  Inform the user that the brief is ready and they can now run Pipeline 01 (Greenfield Launch).
