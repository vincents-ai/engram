  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Clean and calibrate raw sensor data for accuracy.
  1. Filter noise and process signals using Agent 61.
  2. Analyse the statistical properties of the data using Agent 20.
  3. Generate visualisation of the calibrated data using Agent 29.

  Calibrate the input from the {{ sensor_type }} sensor.
    
  1. 'agent_61_the_dsp': Apply the {{ filter_method }} to the raw dataset to reduce noise.
  2. 'agent_20_the_critical_roller': Verify the variance and standard deviation of the filtered output.
  3. 'agent_29_the_visualisation_expert': Plot the pre- and post-calibration data for comparison.
