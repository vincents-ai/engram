  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Tune the OS for deterministic performance.
  1. Profile the system latency and interrupts using Agent 60.
  2. Isolate CPU cores and tune kernel parameters using Agent 60.
  3. Verify the worst-case execution time (WCET) using Agent 20.

  Tune system for {{ target_latency_us }}us latency for {{ application_process }}.
    
  1. 'agent_60_the_real_time': Run cyclictest to establish a baseline latency.
  2. 'agent_60_the_real_time': Apply CPU shielding and IRQ affinity settings to isolate {{ application_process }}.
  3. 'agent_20_the_critical_roller': Re-run tests to confirm the p99 latency is below {{ target_latency_us }}us.
