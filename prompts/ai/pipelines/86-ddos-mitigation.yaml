  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Protect infrastructure from denial of service.
  1. Analyse traffic patterns to identify the attack signature using Agent 13 (acting as traffic analyst).
  2. Configure firewall rules (iptables/nftables) using Agent 07.
  3. Implement rate limiting using Agent 03.

  1. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Capture a sample of traffic to isolate the malicious IP ranges or payloads.
  2. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Apply a drop rule for the identified signature in `nftables`.
  3. 'agent_03_the_architect': Update the Nginx or HAProxy config to limit requests per second.
