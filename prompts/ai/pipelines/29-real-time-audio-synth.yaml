  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Develop a performant software synthesiser.
  1. Implement the audio generation logic in Rust using Agent 70.
  2. Ensure real-time performance and memory safety using Agent 60.
  3. Design the signal chain and oscillator algorithms using Agent 63.

prompt: |
  Build a {{ waveform }} synth in Rust with {{ buffer_size }} frame buffer.
    
  1. 'agent_63_the_synthesiser': Define the mathematical model for the {{ waveform }} oscillator.
  2. 'agent_70_the_rustacean': Implement the audio callback loop in Rust, ensuring zero allocations.
  3. 'agent_60_the_real_time': Verify that the processing completes within the {{ buffer_size }} frame deadline.
