  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Perform Fast Fourier Transform on data.
  1. Load the time-domain data using Agent 29 (acting as data loader).
  2. Compute the FFT spectrum using Agent 73 (acting as math expert).
  3. Visualise the frequency domain using Agent 29.

  Perform FFT on {{ data_file }} (Fs={{ sampling_rate }}Hz).
    
  1. 'agent_29_the_visualisation_expert': Read the raw signal data.
  2. 'agent_73_the_prime': Apply a window function (e.g., Hamming) and calculate the FFT.
  3. 'agent_29_the_visualisation_expert': Plot the Power Spectral Density (PSD) to identify dominant frequencies.
