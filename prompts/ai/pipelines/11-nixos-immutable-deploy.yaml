title: NixOS Immutable Deploy
description: Create a reproducible NixOS configuration and ISO.
instructions: 'Create a reproducible, immutable NixOS system configuration and build a deployable ISO image.


  1. Define the system configuration and flake inputs using The DevOps Engineer (acting as The Snowflake).

  2. Build the ISO image and verify closure size using The DevOps Engineer (acting as The Iso).

  3. Validate the build reproducibility and lock dependencies using The Architect.

  1. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Draft the `flake.nix` and `configuration.nix`. Ensure all inputs are pinned. Build the ISO image using `nix build`.

  2. ''agent_03_the_architect'': Review the configuration for structural soundness and ensure it adheres to immutable infrastructure principles. Verify that no mutable state is leaked outside of persisted volumes.
