instructions:
  
  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

 'Create a reproducible, immutable NixOS system configuration and build a deployable ISO image.


  1. Define the system configuration and flake inputs using The DevOps Engineer (acting as The Snowflake).

  2. Build the ISO image and verify closure size using The DevOps Engineer (acting as The Iso).

  3. Validate the build reproducibility and lock dependencies using The Architect.

prompt: 'We need to build an immutable NixOS ISO for {{ hostname }} on {{ target_architecture }}.


  1. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Draft the `flake.nix` and `configuration.nix`. Ensure all inputs are pinned. Build the ISO image using `nix build`.

  2. ''agent_03_the_architect'': Review the configuration for structural soundness and ensure it adheres to immutable infrastructure principles. Verify that no mutable state is leaked outside of persisted volumes.
