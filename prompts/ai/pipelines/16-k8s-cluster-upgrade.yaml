  1. ''agent_03_the_architect'': Check for deprecated APIs in {{ target_version }}. Ensure our manifests are compatible.

  2. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Start the rolling upgrade. Upgrade the Control Plane first.

  3. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Cycle the worker nodes: Cordon -> Drain -> Upgrade/Replace -> Uncordon.

  4. ''agent_28_the_survivor'': Continuously monitor pod health and restarts. Halt the process if error rates spike.
