  1. ''agent_49_the_prospector'': Dig through the usage reports. Find idle instances, unattached volumes, and over-provisioned databases.

  2. ''agent_04_the_monetiser'': Calculate the ROI of purchasing reserved instances vs. on-demand. Look for savings plans.

  3. ''agent_49_the_prospector'': Generate a prioritized list of actions to reduce the monthly bill.

  4. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Draft the Terraform/OpenTofu changes needed to apply the downsizing (e.g., changing instance types).
