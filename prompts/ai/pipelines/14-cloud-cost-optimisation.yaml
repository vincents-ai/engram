description: Analyse resource usage and suggest downsizing.
instructions:
  
  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

 'Audit cloud infrastructure and resource usage to identify waste and reduce costs.


  1. Analyse current billing and usage data using The Prospector.

  2. Identify underutilised resources and potential downsizing opportunities using The Prospector.

  3. Recommend reserved instances or spot instances where applicable using The Monetiser.

  4. Implement approved changes using The DevOps Engineer.

  1. ''agent_49_the_prospector'': Dig through the usage reports. Find idle instances, unattached volumes, and over-provisioned databases.

  2. ''agent_04_the_monetiser'': Calculate the ROI of purchasing reserved instances vs. on-demand. Look for savings plans.

  3. ''agent_49_the_prospector'': Generate a prioritized list of actions to reduce the monthly bill.

  4. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Draft the Terraform/OpenTofu changes needed to apply the downsizing (e.g., changing instance types).
