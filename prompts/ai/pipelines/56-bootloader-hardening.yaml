  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Secure the boot chain of the device.
  1. Configure Secure Boot keys and signatures using Agent 07.
  2. Set up the bootloader password and configuration using Agent 07.
  3. Seal secrets to the TPM PCRs using Agent 07.

  Harden {{ bootloader_type }} with Secure Boot and TPM {{ tpm_version }}.
    
  1. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Generate custom Secure Boot keys and sign the kernel and bootloader.
  2. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Configure {{ bootloader_type }} to require a password for editing entries.
  3. 'agent_07_the_double_o': Enrol the platform configuration in the TPM to prevent tampering.
