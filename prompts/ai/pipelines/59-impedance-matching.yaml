  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Calculate and verify PCB trace impedance.
  1. Calculate required trace width based on stackup using Agent 73.
  2. Adjust the PCB layout design using Agent 57.
  3. Verify the calculations against standard models using Agent 73.

  Match traces to {{ target_impedance }} Ohms with {{ dielectric_height }} stackup.
    
  1. 'agent_73_the_prime': Use standard formulas (Microstrip/Stripline) to solve for trace width.
  2. 'agent_57_the_router': Update the PCB design rules to enforce this width for relevant net classes.
  3. 'agent_73_the_prime': Double-check the calculation assuming standard FR4 dielectric constant (4.2).
