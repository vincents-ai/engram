  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Generate visuals by intentionally corrupting image data.
  1. Load the image and convert to raw bytes using Agent 10.
  2. Randomly flip bits or inject noise using Agent 77 (acting as chaos artist).
  3. Attempt to render the corrupted file using Agent 10.

  Glitch {{ source_image }} with {{ intensity }} intensity.
    
  1. 'agent_10_the_perfect_10': Convert the image to a raw bitmap or JPEG format.
  2. 'agent_13_the_gremlin': Apply random byte manipulation (databending) to the file header and body.
  3. 'agent_10_the_perfect_10': Save the result, retrying if the file is completely unreadable.
