  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Migrate loose JavaScript to strict TypeScript.
  1. Audit the codebase for `any` types and missing interfaces using Agent 72.
  2. Define the strict type definitions and interfaces using Agent 72.
  3. Refactor the components to satisfy the compiler using Agent 16.

  Migrate {{ src_dir }} to TypeScript ({{ strictness_level }}).
    
  1. 'agent_72_the_type_safe': Generate `interface` and `type` definitions for all data structures.
  2. 'agent_16_the_16_bit': Rename files to .ts/.tsx and fix the immediate syntax errors.
  3. 'agent_72_the_type_safe': Systematically replace `any` with specific types until `tsc` passes.
