description: "Verify PCB manufacturability."
instructions: |
  Ensure the PCB can be produced by the fab house.
  1. Load the manufacturer's capabilities (DRC rules) using Agent 75.
  2. Run the DFM analysis on the layout using Agent 75.
  3. Generate a report of violations using Agent 75.

  Perform DFM check on {{ gerber_files }} for {{ fab_house }}.
    
  1. 'agent_75_the_solder': Import the constraints (min track, min hole, clearance) for {{ fab_house }}.
  2. 'agent_75_the_solder': Analyse the copper layers and drill files for violations.
  3. 'agent_75_the_solder': Output a "Go/No-Go" decision and a list of locations to fix.
