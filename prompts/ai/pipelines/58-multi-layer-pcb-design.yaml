  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Design complex multi-layer printed circuit boards.
  1. Define the layer stackup and materials using Agent 57.
  2. Route high-speed signals with impedance control using Agent 57.
  3. Perform a Design Rule Check (DRC) for manufacturing using Agent 75.

  Design a {{ layer_count }}-layer PCB for {{ signal_speed }} signals.
    
  1. 'agent_57_the_router': Define the stackup (dielectric constant, copper thickness) to support controlled impedance.
  2. 'agent_57_the_router': Route critical nets with length matching and differential pairs.
  3. 'agent_75_the_solder': Verify that the design meets the fab house's min track/space capabilities.
