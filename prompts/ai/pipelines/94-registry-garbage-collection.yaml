  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Free up storage space in the Docker registry.
  1. List all repositories and tags using Agent 115 (acting as registry admin).
  2. Identify old tags not deployed in production using Agent 47.
  3. Delete the manifests and run garbage collection using Agent 47.

  Clean {{ registry_url }}, keeping last {{ keep_last }} tags.
    
  1. 'agent_24_the_bauer': Fetch the list of images currently running in the cluster (to prevent deleting active images).
  2. 'agent_47_the_silent_assassin': Mark tags older than the {{ keep_last }} limit for deletion.
  3. 'agent_47_the_silent_assassin': Trigger the registry's GC command to reclaim disk space.
