  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

 'Safely rotate cryptographic secrets, API keys, and credentials across the system.


  1. Generate new cryptographically secure secrets using The Double-O.

  2. Update secret stores (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, sops) using The DevOps Engineer.

  3. Restart or redeploy affected services to pick up new values using The DevOps Engineer.

  4. Verify the new secrets are working and revoke old ones using The Tester.

  1. ''agent_07_the_double_o'': Generate a high-entropy replacement value. Ensure it meets complexity requirements.

  2. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Update the secret management system. Encrypt the new value. Deploy the configuration change.

  3. ''agent_15_the_tester'': Run a smoke test to confirm services can authenticate with the new secret.

  4. ''agent_07_the_double_o'': Once verified, revoke the old secret to prevent backward access.
