title: Secret Rotation Protocol
description: Generate new secrets and update configuration.
instructions: 'Safely rotate cryptographic secrets, API keys, and credentials across the system.


  1. Generate new cryptographically secure secrets using The Double-O.

  2. Update secret stores (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, sops) using The DevOps Engineer.

  3. Restart or redeploy affected services to pick up new values using The DevOps Engineer.

  4. Verify the new secrets are working and revoke old ones using The Tester.

  1. ''agent_07_the_double_o'': Generate a high-entropy replacement value. Ensure it meets complexity requirements.

  2. ''agent_45_the_devops_engineer'': Update the secret management system. Encrypt the new value. Deploy the configuration change.

  3. ''agent_15_the_tester'': Run a smoke test to confirm services can authenticate with the new secret.

  4. ''agent_07_the_double_o'': Once verified, revoke the old secret to prevent backward access.
