  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  Create audio assets programmatically.
  1. Define the synthesis parameters and randomization ranges using Agent 63.
  2. Generate the audio samples using Agent 61.
  3. Export and catalogue the assets using Agent 25.

prompt: |
  Generate {{ quantity }} variations of {{ sfx_type }}.
    
  1. 'agent_63_the_synthesiser': Write the patch definition for a {{ sfx_type }} sound.
  2. 'agent_61_the_dsp': Render the audio, applying random pitch and envelope modulation for variety.
  3. 'agent_25_the_quartermaster': Save the files with proper naming conventions and metadata.
