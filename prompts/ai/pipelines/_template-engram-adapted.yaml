# ENGRAM-ADAPTED PIPELINE TEMPLATE
# This template adapts Goose pipelines for engram workflow

  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

  You are the Pipeline Manager. Your job is to orchestrate work using engram.

  ENGRAM WORKFLOW PATTERN:

  1. CREATE WORKFLOW:
     ```bash
     WORKFLOW_ID=$(engram workflow create \
       --title "[Workflow Name]" \
       --description "[Description]" \
       --json | jq -r '.id')
     ```

  2. ADD STATES:
     ```bash
     engram workflow add-state --name "stage1" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
     engram workflow add-state --name "stage2" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
     engram workflow add-state --name "stage3" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
     ```

  3. ADD TRANSITIONS:
     ```bash
     engram workflow add-transition \
       --from "stage1" --to "stage2" \
       --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
     engram workflow add-transition \
       --from "stage2" --to "stage3" \
       --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
     ```

  4. START WORKFLOW:
     ```bash
     engram workflow start \
       --agent pipeline-manager \
       --entity-id [PARENT_TASK_ID] \
       --entity-type task \
       $WORKFLOW_ID
     ```

  5. TRACK PROGRESS:
     ```bash
     engram workflow status [INSTANCE_ID]
     ```

parameters:
  properties:
    feature_idea:
      type: string
      description: "The work to be done"
    parent_task_id:
      type: string
      description: "The engram parent task ID"
  required:
    - feature_idea
    - parent_task_id

sub_recipes:
- name: [stage1_name]
  path: ./agents/[agent-name-engram-adapted].yaml
  description: [Description]

  path: ./agents/[agent-name-engram-adapted].yaml
  description: [Description]

prompt: |
  Orchestrating: "{{ feature_idea }}"

  PARENT TASK: {{parent_task_id}}

  ENGRAM WORKFLOW STEPS:

  STEP 1: Create workflow structure
  ```bash
  WORKFLOW_ID=$(engram workflow create \
    --title "[Feature] Workflow" \
    --description "Orchestrating: {{feature_idea}}" \
    --json | jq -r '.id')

  engram workflow add-state --name "planning" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
  engram workflow add-state --name "execution" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
  engram workflow add-state --name "verification" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
  engram workflow add-state --name "complete" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID

  engram workflow add-transition --from "planning" --to "execution" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
  engram workflow add-transition --from "execution" --to "verification" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
  engram workflow add-transition --from "verification" --to "complete" --workflow-id $WORKFLOW_ID
  ```

  STEP 2: Start workflow
  ```bash
  engram workflow start \
    --agent pipeline \
    --entity-id {{parent_task_id}} \
    --entity-type task \
    $WORKFLOW_ID
  ```

  STEP 3: Execute stages (each calls engram-adapted agent)

  STEP 4: Track completion
  ```bash
  engram workflow status [INSTANCE_ID]
  ```

  Return JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "parent_task_id": "{{parent_task_id}}",
    "workflow_id": "$WORKFLOW_ID",
    "status": "workflow_created",
    "stages": ["planning", "execution", "verification", "complete"]
  }
  ```
