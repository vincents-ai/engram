# HACCP Hazard Analysis Audit Prompts

This collection provides comprehensive audit checkpoint prompts for HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) implementation and assessment.

## Context and Background

### HACCP: Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points
**Effective Date**: 1990s (Codex Alimentarius guidelines, various national implementations)  
**Scope**: Food safety management in food production and processing  
**Key Principles**: Hazard analysis, critical control points, critical limits, monitoring, corrective actions, verification, record keeping  
**Structure**: Seven principles for systematic food safety management  
**Benefits**: Proactive food safety management, regulatory compliance, consumer protection, risk reduction

## Regulatory Context
- **HACCP**: Internationally recognized food safety management system
- **Regulatory Requirement**: Required by FDA, EU, and many national food safety regulations
- **Codex Guidelines**: FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius standards
- **Global Application**: Applicable to all food processing operations

## HACCP Comprehensive Hazard Analysis Audit Prompt

Conduct comprehensive HACCP hazard analysis audit:

**Food Processing Type:** [MEAT_DAIRY_BAKERY_BEVERAGE_PROCESSING]

2. **Principle 2: Determine Critical Control Points**
   - Assess CCP identification methodology
   - Review process flow diagram accuracy
   - Validate CCP determination process
   - Confirm CCP documentation completeness

3. **Principle 3: Establish Critical Limits**
   - Evaluate critical limit scientific basis
   - Assess limit measurability requirements
   - Review limit achievability validation
   - Validate limit documentation procedures

4. **Principle 4: Establish Monitoring Procedures**
   - Assess monitoring procedure development
   - Review monitoring frequency determination
   - Validate monitoring responsibility assignment
   - Confirm monitoring record maintenance

5. **Principle 5: Establish Corrective Actions**
   - Evaluate corrective action procedure development
   - Assess deviation response mechanisms
   - Review corrective action effectiveness
   - Validate corrective action documentation

6. **Principle 6: Establish Verification Procedures**
   - Assess verification procedure development
   - Review verification frequency determination
   - Validate verification method effectiveness
   - Confirm verification record maintenance

7. **Principle 7: Establish Record-Keeping Procedures**
   - Evaluate record-keeping system design
   - Assess record completeness requirements
   - Review record retention procedures
   - Validate record accessibility and security

**HACCP Compliance Scoring:**
- **Hazard Analysis**: [SCORE]/100
- **Critical Control Points**: [SCORE]/100
- **Critical Limits**: [SCORE]/100
- **Monitoring Procedures**: [SCORE]/100
- **Corrective Actions**: [SCORE]/100
- **Verification Procedures**: [SCORE]/100
- **Record-Keeping**: [SCORE]/100

## HACCP Hazard Assessment Framework

**Hazard Categories:**
- **Biological Hazards**: Pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins
- **Chemical Hazards**: Pesticides, cleaning chemicals, allergens, contaminants
- **Physical Hazards**: Foreign materials, glass, metal, plastic fragments

**HACCP Plan Components:**
- **Product Description**: Ingredients, processing methods, packaging, shelf-life
- **Intended Use**: Target consumers, preparation methods, storage conditions
- **Process Flow Diagram**: Manufacturing process from raw materials to finished product
- **Hazard Analysis**: Identification and evaluation of potential hazards

## HACCP Integration with Other Standards

**Multi-Framework Compliance:**
- HACCP + ISO 22000: [ALIGNMENT_SCORE]/100
- HACCP + FSSC 22000: [ALIGNMENT_SCORE]/100
- HACCP + GMP: [ALIGNMENT_SCORE]/100

**HACCP Framework:**
1. **Preliminary Steps and Hazard Analysis**
2. **CCP Determination and Critical Limits**
3. **Monitoring and Corrective Action Systems**
4. **Verification and Record-Keeping**
5. **HACCP Plan Maintenance and Continuous Improvement**
