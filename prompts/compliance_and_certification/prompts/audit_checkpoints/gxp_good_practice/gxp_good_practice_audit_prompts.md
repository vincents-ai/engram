# GxP Good Practice Guidelines Audit Prompts


  
  EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - provide evidence-based validation for all final claims instead of unsubstantiated assertions
  - Every assertion must be supported by concrete evidence from code, tests, logs, or documentation
  - Include specific examples, file paths, line numbers, and verifiable measurements
  - Provide quantifiable metrics and test results when making claims about improvements
  - Reference official documentation or standards when applicable

  EVIDENCE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Always provide evidence in this format:
    ## Claim: [Your specific assertion]
    ### Evidence:
    - **Code Reference**: `src/file.rs:123` - Function demonstrates...
    - **Test Results**: [Command output showing results]
    - **Execution Log**: [Timestamped log entries]
    - **Documentation**: [Citations from official docs]
  - Never make unsubstantiated claims like "the code is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better", "this improves security", or "the refactoring is better"
  - Instead, provide quantifiable evidence: "Reduced processing time from 500ms to 120ms"

This collection provides comprehensive audit checkpoint prompts for GxP (Good Practice Guidelines) implementation and assessment across GLP, GMP, GCP, and GDP.

## Context and Background

### GxP: Good Practice Guidelines
**Effective Date**: Various (GLP 1970s, GMP 1960s, GCP 1990s, GDP 2010s)  
**Scope**: Quality assurance in regulated industries (pharmaceuticals, medical devices, clinical research)  
**Key Principles**: Data integrity, quality assurance, regulatory compliance, documentation, validation  
**Structure**: GLP (laboratory), GMP (manufacturing), GCP (clinical), GDP (distribution)  
**Benefits**: Regulatory compliance, product quality assurance, data integrity, patient safety

## Regulatory Context
- **GxP**: Umbrella term for good practice guidelines in regulated industries
- **FDA Oversight**: U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements
- **International Standards**: Harmonized requirements across jurisdictions
