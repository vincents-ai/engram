# REACH and RoHS Chemical Regulation Audit Prompts

This collection provides comprehensive audit checkpoint prompts for REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) and RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) compliance assessment.

## Context and Background

### REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals)
**Effective Date**: June 1, 2007 (main regulation), phased implementation through 2018  
**Scope**: Chemical substances manufactured or imported in EU (1 tonne/year or more)  
**Key Requirements**: Registration, evaluation, authorization, restriction of chemicals  
**Structure**: Regulation covering the entire lifecycle of chemical substances  
**Benefits**: Protection of human health and environment, promotion of alternative substances, improved risk management

### RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances)
**Effective Date**: July 1, 2006 (original directive), updated versions through RoHS 3  
**Scope**: Electrical and electronic equipment placed on EU market  
**Key Requirements**: Restriction of hazardous substances in EEE products  
**Structure**: Directive with restricted substances list and concentration limits  
**Benefits**: Reduction of hazardous waste, improved recycling, protection of human health and environment

## Regulatory Context
- **REACH**: Comprehensive EU chemicals regulation
- **RoHS**: Specific restriction on hazardous substances in electronics
- **Global Impact**: Influences chemical regulations worldwide
- **Implementation**: Through national authorities and ECHA (European Chemicals Agency)
