Always use engram. You need to proceed with the tasks from engram, if you find issues create tasks to resolve them. update you're engram task status as they change so you don't waste time and duplicate efforts. Remember to research tasks when required, used webfetch, etc, as needed. Maintain any issues or suggestions you find during youre work in engram, tag them so you can find them them again.
