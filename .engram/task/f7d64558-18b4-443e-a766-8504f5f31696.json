Ready for CLI integration and real gate implementations.","priority":"medium","start_time":"2026-01-19T13:47:03.839975563Z","status":"done","title":"Implement Progressive Quality Gates System"}},"content_hash":"78c0acd2f3b9ee115e8686b4f7482b8f285c91ea79ff3eee43e32e81f12a30d3","size_bytes":1367,"tags":[],"references":[],"metadata":{}}
