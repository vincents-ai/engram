# Roadmap Planning (Engram-Integrated)

## Overview

Design multi-quarter engineering roadmaps that align technical initiatives with business objectives, establish clear milestones, manage dependencies across teams, and communicate progress to stakeholders. Store roadmap plans, milestone definitions, and strategic rationale in Engram for transparent execution tracking.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Planning work beyond next sprint (quarterly or annual planning)
- Stakeholders ask "what are we building next quarter?"
- Multiple teams need to coordinate on shared objectives
- Need to justify headcount or budget allocation
- Product and engineering roadmaps need alignment
- Company OKRs require technical enablement

## The Pattern

### Step 1: Define Strategic Themes

Identify high-level themes that guide roadmap:

```bash
engram context create \
  --title "Roadmap Themes: [Year/Quarter]" \
  --content "## Planning Period\n\n**Timeframe:** [e.g., 2026 Q2-Q4 (6 months)]\n**Planning Date:** [Date]\n**Review Cadence:** [e.g., Monthly review, quarterly refresh]\n\n## Company Strategy Context\n\n**Company Mission:** [e.g., Empower teams to collaborate effectively]\n\n**Company OKRs ([Year]):**\n1. **[Objective 1]:** [e.g., Increase enterprise revenue 100%]\n   - KR1: [e.g., Close 100 enterprise deals]\n   - KR2: [e.g., Expand to 5 verticals]\n   - KR3: [e.g., Achieve $500K ARR from enterprise]\n\n2. **[Objective 2]:** [e.g., Achieve product-market fit in SMB segment]\n   - KR1: [e.g., 10K active users]\n   - KR2: [e.g., <5% monthly churn]\n   - KR3: [e.g., NPS >50]\n\n3. **[Objective 3]:** [e.g., Build world-class engineering team]\n   - KR1: [e.g., Hire 10 engineers]\n   - KR2: [e.g., <10% attrition]\n   - KR3: [e.g., Deploy daily with <1% rollback rate]\n\n## Strategic Themes\n\nThemes are multi-quarter focus areas that span multiple initiatives.\n\n### Theme 1: Enterprise Readiness\n\n**Vision:** Make product suitable for 500+ employee companies\n\n**Why now:** Enterprise segment has 10x higher LTV ($50K vs $5K) and lower churn (3% vs 15%). Current product only serves SMB.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- 100 enterprise customers by end of period\n- Enterprise features adopted by 90% of enterprise users\n- <5% enterprise churn\n- Enterprise revenue = $500K ARR\n\n**Key capabilities needed:**\n- Advanced security (SSO, RBAC, audit logs)\n- Scale (10K+ users per account)\n- Integrations (Slack, Salesforce, Jira)\n- Support (SLA, dedicated success manager)\n\n**Links to OKRs:** Objective 1 (Enterprise revenue)\n\n### Theme 2: Product Quality\n\n**Vision:** Achieve best-in-class reliability and performance\n\n**Why now:** Current 95% uptime and 2s load times hurt SMB retention. Losing customers to faster, more reliable competitors.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- 99.9% uptime (SLA)\n- p95 page load <500ms (currently 2s)\n- <1% error rate (currently 3%)\n- <5% SMB churn (currently 15%)\n\n**Key capabilities needed:**\n- Monitoring and observability\n- Performance optimization\n- Infrastructure scalability\n- Automated testing and deployment\n\n**Links to OKRs:** Objective 2 (Product-market fit, churn reduction)\n\n### Theme 3: Developer Velocity\n\n**Vision:** Enable team to ship features 2x faster\n\n**Why now:** Competitors shipping features weekly, we ship monthly. Need to accelerate to remain competitive.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Deploy to production daily (currently weekly)\n- <10% rollback rate (currently 25%)\n- Feature development time reduced 50%\n- Developer satisfaction >4/5 (currently 3/5)\n\n**Key capabilities needed:**\n- CI/CD improvements\n- Testing automation\n- Developer tooling\n- Technical debt reduction\n\n**Links to OKRs:** Objective 3 (Engineering team), enables all other objectives\n\n## Theme Prioritization\n\n**Q2 Focus (Apr-Jun):**\n1. Enterprise Readiness (60% capacity) - Highest revenue impact\n2. Product Quality (30% capacity) - Reduces churn\n3. Developer Velocity (10% capacity) - Foundation for future\n\n**Q3 Focus (Jul-Sep):**\n1. Enterprise Readiness (40% capacity) - Continue momentum\n2.

### Step 3: Map Initiatives to Business Objectives

Create clear traceability:

```bash
engram reasoning create \
  --title "Strategic Mapping: [Initiative] → [Business Objective]" \
  --task-id [TASK_ID] \
  --content "## Initiative Summary\n\n**Initiative:** [e.g., Advanced Search (Elasticsearch)]\n**Epic:** Enterprise Feature Set\n**Milestone:** Q2 2026 Enterprise Launch\n**Effort:** 47 story points (~5 weeks)\n\n## Business Objective Linkage\n\n### Company OKR\n\n**Objective:** Increase enterprise revenue 100% in 2026\n\n**Key Result 1:** Close 100 enterprise deals by Dec 31\n- **Contribution:** Advanced search is core enterprise tier feature\n- **Impact:** Without search, enterprise tier lacks differentiation (0 deals)\n- **Measurement:** 50 deals in Q2 target (50% of annual)\n\n**Key Result 2:** Expand to 5 verticals (Healthcare, Finance, Legal, Education, Government)\n- **Contribution:** Search enables compliance (audit trail for regulated industries)\n- **Impact:** Healthcare vertical requires searchable audit logs for HIPAA\n- **Measurement:** Healthcare deals require this feature\n\n**Key Result 3:** Achieve $500K ARR from enterprise tier\n- **Contribution:** Enterprise tier priced at $199/month (vs $49 standard)\n- **Impact:** Search is primary value driver for 4x price increase\n- **Measurement:** $50K ARR Q2 target (10% of annual), $150K Q3, $300K Q4\n\n### Product Roadmap\n\n**Theme:** Enterprise Readiness\n**Milestone:** Q2 Enterprise Launch (June 30, 2026)\n\n**Critical Path:**\n- Q2: Deliver enterprise features (search, payments, SSO)\n- Q3: Scale to 100 enterprise customers\n- Q4: Expand to 5 verticals\n\n**This initiative enables:**\n- Q2 milestone (core feature)\n- Q3 milestone (required for scale)\n- Q4 milestone (required for healthcare vertical)\n\n### Market Positioning\n\n**Market Segment:** Enterprise collaboration tools\n**Target Customer:** 500-5000 employee companies\n**Price Point:** $199/month per account (vs competitors $150-$300/month)\n\n**Competitive Analysis:**\n- Competitor A: Advanced search ✓ (Elasticsearch, <100ms)\n- Competitor B: Advanced search ✓ (Algolia, typo-tolerance)\n- Competitor C: Basic search only (SQL, slow)\n- **Us (current):** Basic search only (SQL, 2+ seconds, 100 result limit)\n- **Us (after initiative):** Advanced search ✓ (Elasticsearch, <200ms, unlimited)\n\n**Position After Initiative:**\n- Competitive parity with A and B (table stakes)\n- Clear advantage over C\n- Unlocks enterprise sales conversations\n\n### Revenue Model\n\n**Direct Revenue:**\n- Enterprise tier: $199/month (4x standard $49/month)\n- Projected adoption: 50 customers in Q2, 100 by end of year\n- Q2 revenue impact: $50K ARR\n- Annual revenue impact: $200K+ ARR\n\n**Revenue Breakdown:**\n- Without search: 0 enterprise customers (no value proposition)\n- With search: 50 Q2, 100 annual (proven demand from sales pipeline)\n- Revenue delta: $200K ARR attributed to this initiative\n\n**Indirect Revenue:**\n- Reduces churn: Power users stay for better search (5% → 3% churn)\n- Churn value: 2% of 1000 users × $49/mo × 12 = $11.8K ARR saved\n- Upsell: 20% of standard users interested in enterprise tier\n\n**Total Revenue Impact:** $211.8K ARR\n\n### Customer Impact\n\n**Pain Point:** Customers can't find documents in large accounts (100K+ documents)\n- Current search: SQL full-text, 2+ second latency, 100 result limit\n- Customer complaints: \"Search is unusable\", \"Faster to use Google Drive\"\n- Churn: 3 power users churned last quarter citing search\n\n**Solution:** Elasticsearch-powered search <200ms, relevance ranking, no limits\n- Expected: 10x faster search, 90%+ relevant results\n- User research: 15 prospects said \"better search\" is reason to buy\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n- Usage: >80% of enterprise users use search weekly\n- Performance: p95 latency <200ms (vs 2+ seconds currently)\n- Satisfaction: >4/5 rating for search quality\n- Churn: Enterprise churn <5% (vs 15% standard tier)\n\n### Risk to Business If Not Delivered\n\n**Revenue Risk:** Lose $200K+ ARR opportunity\n- Enterprise tier not competitive without search\n- Sales pipeline worth $500K blocked on this feature\n\n**Market Position Risk:** Fall further behind competitors\n- Competitors A and B launched search in 2025\n- We're losing deals: 10 prospects chose competitors due to search\n\n**Strategic Risk:** Can't enter enterprise market\n- Enterprise requires advanced search (table stakes)\n- Without search, stuck in SMB segment (lower LTV)\n- Limits company growth trajectory\n\n**Customer Risk:** Existing power users churn\n- 15% churn in standard tier (industry avg 10%)\n- Search quality cited in 40% of churn surveys\n- Projected: 5% additional churn if not improved\n\n## Decision Framework\n\n**Why prioritize this initiative:**\n\n1. **Strategic Alignment:** Direct link to company OKR (100% enterprise revenue growth)\n2. **Revenue Impact:** $200K+ ARR (highest ROI of Q2 initiatives)\n3. **Customer Demand:** Proven (15 prospects waiting, sales pipeline $500K)\n4. **Competitive Necessity:** Table stakes for enterprise segment\n5. **Feasible:** 47 points fits in Q2 timeline (13 weeks available)\n\n**Why not defer to Q3:**\n- Sales pipeline $500K blocked (revenue opportunity cost)\n- Competitors launched Q1 2026 (market window closing)\n- Q2 enterprise launch depends on this (critical path)\n- Customer commitments made (5 beta customers promised June)\n\n**Trade-offs Accepted:**\n- **Technical debt:** Elasticsearch adds operational complexity\n- **Cost:** $500/month infrastructure (offset by $16K/month revenue)\n- **Team focus:** Takes 1 senior engineer for 5 weeks (Alice)\n- **Risk:** Complexity unknown (mitigated by spike)\n\n## Measurement Plan\n\n**Leading Indicators (Weekly):**\n- Feature development progress (story points completed)\n- Elasticsearch cluster health (uptime, query latency)\n- Beta customer feedback (NPS, feature usage)\n\n**Lagging Indicators (Monthly):**\n- Enterprise deals closed (target: 50 in Q2)\n- Enterprise revenue (target: $50K ARR Q2)\n- Feature adoption (target: 80% of enterprise users)\n- Search satisfaction (target: >4/5 rating)\n\n**Dashboard:** https://metabase.example.com/dashboard/okr-enterprise-revenue\n\n**Review Cadence:**\n- Weekly: Engineering lead checks feature progress\n- Monthly: OKR review with executive team\n- Quarterly: Board presentation on enterprise growth\n\n**Confidence:** 0.85" \

## Example

User needs to plan engineering roadmap for H2 2026 aligned with company OKRs.

### Step 1: Define Themes

```bash
THEMES=$(engram context create \
  --title "Roadmap Themes: 2026 H2 (Q3-Q4)" \
  --content "## Planning Period\n\n**Timeframe:** 2026 Q3-Q4 (Jul-Dec, 6 months)\n**Planning Date:** March 20, 2026\n**Review Cadence:** Monthly review (last Friday), quarterly refresh\n\n## Company Strategy Context\n\n**Company Mission:** Empower teams to collaborate effectively in the modern workplace\n\n**Company OKRs (2026):**\n\n1. **Increase enterprise revenue 100%**\n   - KR1: Close 100 enterprise deals by Dec 31 (currently 0)\n   - KR2: Expand to 5 verticals (Healthcare, Finance, Legal, Education, Gov)\n   - KR3: Achieve $500K ARR from enterprise tier\n\n2. **Achieve product-market fit in SMB segment**\n   - KR1: 10K active users (currently 8K)\n   - KR2: <5% monthly churn (currently 15%)\n   - KR3: NPS >50 (currently 35)\n\n3. **Build world-class engineering team**\n   - KR1: Hire 10 engineers (currently 12, target 22)\n   - KR2: <10% attrition (currently 8%)\n   - KR3: Deploy daily with <1% rollback rate\n\n## Strategic Themes\n\n### Theme 1: Enterprise Scale\n\n**Vision:** Scale from 50 to 200 enterprise customers\n\n**Why now:** Q2 delivered enterprise features (payments, search, SSO). Q3-Q4 focus on customer acquisition and onboarding at scale.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- 200 enterprise customers by Dec 31 (50 in Q2 + 150 in H2)\n- Enterprise ARR $500K (Q2: $50K, Q3: +$150K, Q4: +$300K)\n- <5% enterprise churn\n- 90%+ feature adoption\n- 24-hour support response SLA\n\n**Key capabilities needed:**\n- Sales enablement (demos, training, collateral)\n- Customer onboarding automation\n- Enterprise support infrastructure\n- Account management dashboards\n- Usage analytics and reporting\n\n**Links to OKRs:** Objective 1 (Enterprise revenue 100% growth)\n\n**Resource allocation:** 40% capacity (5-6 engineers)\n\n### Theme 2: Product Quality Excellence\n\n**Vision:** Best-in-class reliability and performance\n\n**Why now:** Q2 achieved 99.9% uptime. Q3-Q4 push to 99.99% and <500ms latency to exceed customer expectations.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- 99.99% uptime (vs 99.9% Q2) - Only 52 min annual downtime\n- p95 page load <500ms (currently 1.5s after Q2 improvements)\n- <0.5% error rate (currently 1%)\n- <5% SMB churn (currently 15%)\n- NPS >50 (currently 35)\n\n**Key capabilities needed:**\n- Frontend performance optimization (bundle splitting, lazy loading)\n- API response time improvements (caching, query optimization)\n- Multi-region deployment (latency reduction for global users)\n- Chaos engineering (proactive failure testing)\n- Performance monitoring dashboards\n\n**Links to OKRs:** Objective 2 (Product-market fit, churn reduction, NPS)\n\n**Resource allocation:** 40% capacity (5-6 engineers)\n\n### Theme 3: Developer Velocity and Scale\n\n**Vision:** Double team size while maintaining productivity\n\n**Why now:** Hiring 10 engineers in H2 (12 → 22). Need infrastructure and processes to onboard and maintain productivity.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Team grows from 12 to 22 engineers\n- Feature delivery time reduced 50% (vs Q1 baseline)\n- Deploy multiple times per day (currently once per day)\n- <1% rollback rate (currently 10%)\n- Developer satisfaction >4/5 (currently 3.5/5)\n- New hire productivity in <30 days (currently 60 days)\n\n**Key capabilities needed:**\n- Feature flag and A/B testing framework\n- Comprehensive developer documentation\n- Internal tooling (scaffolding, debugging)\n- Eng onboarding program\n- Team structure and tech leads\n\n**Links to OKRs:** Objective 3 (Team growth, deploy daily)\n\n**Resource allocation:** 20% capacity (2-3 engineers)\n\n## Theme Prioritization\n\n**Q3 Focus (Jul-Sep):**\n1. Enterprise Scale (40%) - Capitalize on Q2 feature delivery\n2. Product Quality (40%) - Reduce churn, improve NPS\n3. Developer Velocity (20%) - Prepare for Q4 hiring surge\n\n**Q4 Focus (Oct-Dec):**\n1. Enterprise Scale (40%) - Push to 200 customers\n2. Product Quality (30%) - Maintain high bar\n3. Developer Velocity (30%) - Onboard 6+ new engineers\n\n## Resource Allocation\n\n**Current team (Q2):** 12 engineers\n- 4 Backend, 4 Frontend, 2 Full-stack, 2 DevOps\n\n**Q3 team:** 14 engineers (+2 Frontend hired mid-Q2)\n- Enterprise Scale: 6 engineers\n- Product Quality: 6 engineers\n- Developer Velocity: 2 engineers\n\n**Q4 team:** 20 engineers (+6 hired during Q3)\n- Enterprise Scale: 8 engineers\n- Product Quality: 6 engineers\n- Developer Velocity: 6 engineers\n\n**Hiring plan:**\n- Q3: +2 engineers (1 Backend, 1 DevOps)\n- Q4: +6 engineers (2 Backend, 2 Frontend, 1 Full-stack, 1 DevOps)\n- Total H2 hiring: +8 engineers (12 → 20, target 22 includes Q1 2027)\n\n## Dependencies Between Themes\n\n**Theme 1 (Scale) depends on Theme 2 (Quality):**\nEnterprise customers require 99.99% uptime and <500ms performance\n\n**Theme 3 (Velocity) enables Theme 1 (Scale):**\nFaster feature delivery supports customer onboarding and customization\n\n**Theme 2 (Quality) benefits from Theme 3 (Velocity):**\nBetter tooling enables faster quality improvements\n\n## Budget Implications\n\n**Hiring costs:** +8 engineers × $150K avg = $1.2M annual ($600K H2 prorated)\n**Infrastructure:** +$50K (multi-region deployment, monitoring)\n**Tooling:** +$20K (feature flags, A/B testing, monitoring)\n**Total H2 investment:** ~$670K\n\n**Expected return:** $500K ARR enterprise revenue (74% ROI in year 1, break-even year 2)" \
